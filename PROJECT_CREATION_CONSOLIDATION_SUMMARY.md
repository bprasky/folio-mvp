# Project Creation Flow Consolidation - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Streamlined to single canonical flow

---

## What Changed

### Before: Two-Step Confusion
1. Click "Create" → Modal with 2 options
2. "Publish Now" → Simple form → Creates project → **Dead end** (manual navigation)
3. "Project Folder" → Long form → Creates project → Routes to `/project/{id}/setup`

**Problem:** Inconsistent flows, users got lost after "Publish Now"

### After: Single Canonical Flow
1. Click "Create" → Modal with 2 options (reordered)
2. **"Quick Create"** (primary, highlighted) → Simple form → **Auto-routes to media/tagging**
3. "Detailed Setup" (secondary) → Full form → Routes to media/tagging

**Result:** Consistent experience, no dead ends, DB-first persistence

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Consolidated "Publish Now" as Primary Flow

**File:** `src/components/CreateProjectChooser.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<button onClick={goFolder}>Project Folder</button>
<button onClick={goPublishNow}>Publish Now</button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<button onClick={goPublishNow} className="border-2 border-blue-600 bg-blue-50">
  Quick Create  {/* Primary, highlighted */}
</button>
<button onClick={goFolder}>
  Detailed Setup  {/* Secondary */}
</button>
```

**Route:** `/designer/create?intent=publish_now&onboard=1`

---

### 2. ✅ Streamlined Quick Create UI

**File:** `src/app/designer/create/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed two-step state machine (`'meta' | 'tag'`)
- Simplified to single form with immediate routing
- **Uses `router.replace()` to prevent back button issues**
- Added better UI with centered card, focus ring, loading spinner

**Flow:**
```typescript
1. User fills title (+ optional description)
2. Submits → createProjectAction({ name, description, intent: 'publish_now' })
3. Success → router.replace(`/project/${projectId}/setup?onboard=1`)
4. Setup page opens modal for image upload + product tagging
```

**Key Code:**
```typescript
if (res?.ok && res.projectId) {
  const onboard = searchParams?.get('onboard') ?? '1';
  router.replace(`/project/${res.projectId}/setup?onboard=${onboard}`);
}
```

---

### 3. ✅ Added "Continue Setup" for Draft Projects

**File:** `src/app/designer/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<Link href={`/designer/projects/${project.id}`}>
  Manage Project
</Link>
```

**After:**
```tsx
{project.status !== 'published' && (
  <Link href={`/project/${project.id}/setup?onboard=1`}>
    <FaUpload /> Continue Setup  {/* Green button */}
  </Link>
)}
<Link href={`/designer/projects/${project.id}`}>
  Manage Project  {/* Blue button */}
</Link>
```

**Result:**
- Draft projects show prominent "Continue Setup" button
- Clicking reopens the media/tagging modal
- Published projects only show "Manage Project"

## Database Persistence

### ✅ All Data Saved to Database

**Project Creation:**
```typescript
// src/app/actions/projects.ts
createProjectAction({ name, description, intent })
↓
Creates Project record in DB
↓
Returns { ok: true, projectId: "uuid" }
```

**Image Upload:**
```typescript
// Handled by existing upload API
POST /api/upload/image
↓
Stores in Supabase Storage
↓
Creates ProjectImage record { projectId, url, width, height }
```

**Product Tagging:**
```typescript
// src/app/api/tag-product-to-image/route.ts
POST /api/tag-product-to-image
Body: { projectId, productId, imageId, x, y, w, h, note }
↓
Validates project ownership
↓
Creates ProductTag record in DB
```

**Affiliate Links:**
```typescript
// Generated on render (not stored)
generateAffiliateUrl({
  baseUrl: product.url,
  designerId: project.designerId,
  projectId: project.id,
  productId: product.id
})
↓
Returns URL with UTM params
```

## Route Map

### Canonical Flow
```
/designer (dashboard)
    ↓ Click "Create"
    ↓
CreateProjectChooser Modal
    ↓ Click "Quick Create"
    ↓
/designer/create?intent=publish_now&onboard=1
    ↓ Enter title, submit
    ↓ (router.replace)
    ↓
/project/{id}/setup?onboard=1
    ↓ Upload images, tag products
    ↓ Close modal (router.push)
    ↓
/project/{id}
```

### Draft Resume Flow
```
/designer (dashboard)

    ↓
/project/{id}/setup?onboard=1
    ↓ Add more images/tags
    ↓ Close
    ↓
/project/{id}
```

- Already routes back to project page on close

---

## API Endpoints (Existing, Verified)

### POST `/api/projects`
- Creates project with title, description, status
- Used by both Quick Create and Detailed Setup
- Returns `{ id: "uuid" }`

### POST `/api/tag-product-to-image`
- Persists product tags to database
- Validates project ownership
- Creates `ProductTag` record

### GET `/api/projects/${projectId}`
- Fetches project with images and tags
- Used by setup page to load existing data

### DELETE `/api/tag-product-to-image`
- Removes tags from database
- Authorization checks

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. Click "Publish Now" → Fill form → **Dead end**
2. User manually navigates to project
3. Clicks "Add Images & Tag Products" button
4. **Two separate actions** to get to tagging

### After
1. Click "Quick Create" → Fill form → **Auto-opens tagging modal**
2. Upload images, tag products, done
3. **Single seamless flow**, no manual steps

### Reduced Friction
- **Before:** 4+ clicks to tag products
- **After:** 2 clicks to tag products
- **Before:** Confusing modal choices
- **After:** Clear "Quick Create" primary action
- **Before:** Draft projects had no clear next step
- **After:** "Continue Setup" button shows path forward

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Back Button
- Uses `router.replace()` to prevent returning to create form
- User can't accidentally create duplicate projects

### ✅ Multiple Drafts
- Each draft shows "Continue Setup"
- Can work on multiple projects in parallel

### ✅ Session Persistence
- All data saved to DB immediately
- Can close browser, come back later
- "Continue Setup" resumes where you left off

### ✅ Authorization
- Project creation checks role permissions
- Tagging validates project ownership
- Can't tag other designers' projects

### ✅ Missing Images
- Setup page gracefully handles projects with no images
- Can add images anytime via "Continue Setup"

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Creates First Project
```
1. Sign in as designer
2. Click "Create" in nav → Modal opens
3. Click "Quick Create" (blue highlighted button)
4. Enter title: "My First Project"
5. Click "Continue to Upload Images"
   ✅ Project created in DB
   ✅ Auto-routes to /project/{id}/setup
   ✅ Modal opens immediately
6. Upload 3 images
   ✅ Images persist to DB
7. Click first image, tag a product
   ✅ Tag persists to DB
8. Close modal
   ✅ Returns to /project/{id}
   ✅ Images and tags visible
```

### Scenario 2: Resume Draft Project
```
1. Go to /designer dashboard
2. See project with "Draft" badge
3. Click "Continue Setup" (green button)
   ✅ Routes to /project/{id}/setup?onboard=1
   ✅ Modal opens
   ✅ Existing images loaded
4. Add 2 more images
   ✅ New images persist
5. Tag products on all images
   ✅ Tags persist
6. Close modal
   ✅ Returns to project
```

### Scenario 3: Advanced User Needs Detailed Form
```
1. Click "Create" → Modal
2. Click "Detailed Setup"
   ✅ Opens full form with all fields
3. Fill project type, stage, budget, location
4. Submit
   ✅ Creates project with all metadata
   ✅ Still routes to /project/{id}/setup
```

## Technical Notes

### Router Strategy
- **`router.replace()`** used for create flow
  - Prevents back button returning to form
  - Avoids duplicate project creation
- **`router.push()`** used for "Continue Setup"
  - Allows back navigation
  - Non-destructive

### Query Params
- `?intent=publish_now` - Selects Quick Create flow
- `?intent=folder` - Selects Detailed Setup flow
- `?onboard=1` - Indicates onboarding/setup mode

### Component Reuse
- `ProjectCreationModal` used for both:
  - New project setup
  - Existing project editing
- `editingProject` prop determines mode

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these 3 files:

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- src/components/CreateProjectChooser.tsx
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/designer/create/page.tsx
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/designer/page.tsx
```

**Safe to rollback because:**
- No schema changes
- No breaking API changes
- Only UI flow modifications

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Bulk Upload** - Drag & drop multiple images at once
2. **Auto-tagging** - AI suggests products from images
3. **Templates** - Pre-fill common project types
4. **Drafts Auto-save** - Save progress every N seconds
5. **Publish Schedule** - Set future publish date/time

### Not Planned
- Removing "Detailed Setup" option (power users need it)
- Forcing publish (draft workflow is valuable)
- Removing manual tag placement (precision matters)

---

## Summary

### What We Achieved
✅ **Single canonical flow** - "Quick Create" is now the primary path  
✅ **No dead ends** - Auto-routes to media/tagging after creation  
✅ **Draft resumption** - "Continue Setup" makes it clear what to do next  
✅ **DB-first** - All data persists immediately, survives page refreshes  
✅ **Better UX** - Reduced clicks, clearer labels, visual hierarchy  
✅ **Non-breaking** - Advanced users can still use "Detailed Setup"  

### Metrics to Watch
- **Create → Publish completion rate** (expect increase)
- **Draft abandonment rate** (expect decrease)
- **Time to first published project** (expect decrease)
- **Support tickets about "where did my project go"** (expect decrease to zero)
