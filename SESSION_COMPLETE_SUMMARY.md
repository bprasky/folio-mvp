# Session Complete - Designer Profile & Project Flow Overhaul

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Accomplished

This session delivered **5 major improvements** to the Folio MVP, transforming the designer workflow from mock data and fragmented flows to a cohesive, database-connected experience.

---

## 1. Designer Profile Database Connection ✅

### Problem
- Profile page showed hardcoded "Diana Matta" for everyone
- No data persistence
- No editing capability
- 95% mock data

### Solution
- Connected to real user database
- Full edit mode (pencil icon → edit → save)
- All fields editable: name, title, bio, location, phone, email, social links
- Projects load from real database

### Files
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `title`, `phone`, `studio` fields (optional)
- ✅ `src/app/api/designer/profile/route.ts` - NEW (GET/PUT endpoints)
- ✅ `src/app/designer/profile/page.tsx` - Complete refactor

### Impact
**Before:** Everyone sees "Diana Matta"  
**After:** Users see their own profile data, can edit it, changes persist

---

## 2. Project Ownership & Filtering Fix ✅

### Problem
- Projects created by designers didn't appear in `/designer/profile`
- Query only checked one ownership path
- Cache issues caused stale data

### Solution
- Created unified `getMyProjects()` query checking ALL ownership paths
- Added filter parameter: `'all' | 'published' | 'draft'`
- Force fresh data: `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, `cache: 'no-store'`
- Revalidate cache after create/publish

### Files
- ✅ `src/server/queries/getMyProjects.ts` - NEW (unified query)
- ✅ `src/app/api/designer/profile/route.ts` - Uses `getMyProjects('published')`
- ✅ `src/app/actions/projects.ts` - Added `revalidatePath()`
- ✅ `src/app/designer/profile/page.tsx` - No-cache fetch

### Ownership Paths Checked
1. `designerId = userId` ✓
2. `ownerId = userId` ✓
3. `designerOrgId IN userOrgs` ✓
4. `participants.some({ userId })` ✓

### Impact
**Before:** Create project → Profile doesn't show it (cache issues)  
**After:** Create project → Appears immediately in profile (if published)

---

## 3. Published-Only Profile Portfolio ✅

### Problem
- Profile mixed drafts with finished work
- No clear separation between workspace and portfolio

### Solution
- Profile Projects tab: **Published only** (portfolio showcase)
- Dashboard: **All projects** (workspace for drafts + published)
- Natural mental model: Profile = showcase, Dashboard = management

### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Profile
getMyProjects('published')
→ isPublic OR publishedAt OR status='published'

// Dashboard  
includeDrafts=true
→ Shows everything
```

### Impact
**Before:** Profile showed drafts mixed with published (unprofessional)  
**After:** Profile is clean portfolio, dashboard manages all work

---

## 4. Clickable Project Cards with Smart Routing ✅

### Problem
- Cards not clickable
- Unclear how to navigate to projects
- No visual distinction between draft/published

### Solution
- Entire card is clickable `<Link>`
- Smart routing based on status
- Visual draft badges
- Keyboard accessible (Tab + Enter)

### Routing Logic
```typescript
// Draft projects
hrefForProject(draft) 
→ /project/{id}/media?onboard=1  (continue setup)

// Published projects
hrefForProject(published) 
→ /project/{slug} or /project/{id}  (view project)
```

### Files
- ✅ `src/lib/projectRoutes.ts` - NEW (routing utilities)
- ✅ `src/app/designer/profile/page.tsx` - Cards wrapped in Links
- ✅ `src/app/api/designer/profile/route.ts` - Added routing fields

### Impact
**Before:** Click "Manage" button to navigate  
**After:** Click anywhere on card, routes intelligently based on status

---

## 5. Streamlined Project Creation Flow ✅

### Problem
- "Publish Now" flow had dead end after creation
- Users dumped on project page without media/tagging
- Confusing two-step process

### Solution
- Consolidated to single flow
- "Quick Create" → Auto-routes to media/tagging
- Added "Continue Setup" button for drafts
- Uses `router.replace()` to prevent back button issues

### Flow
```
Click "Create"
  ↓
Choose "Quick Create" (highlighted)
  ↓
Enter title & description
  ↓
Submit → Project created
  ↓
Auto-routes to /project/{id}/setup
  ↓
Modal opens for image upload + tagging
  ↓
Upload & tag → Persist to DB
  ↓
Close → Done!
```

### Files
- ✅ `src/components/CreateProjectChooser.tsx` - Reordered options
- ✅ `src/app/designer/create/page.tsx` - Simplified flow
- ✅ `src/app/designer/page.tsx` - Added "Continue Setup" button

### Impact
**Before:** 4+ clicks to start tagging, manual navigation  
**After:** 2 clicks to start tagging, seamless auto-routing

---

## 6. Project Boards-First Layout ✅

### Problem
- Project detail pages defaulted to Overview tab
- Hero was expandable/collapsible (distracting)
- Overview details took up main content area

### Solution
- Default to Designer Boards tab
- Fixed-height hero (256px, no expand/collapse)
- Overview moved to modal via kebab menu (⋯)
- Installed `@headlessui/react` for Dialog component

### Layout
```
Hero (Fixed 256px)
  [Project Title - Serif Font]
  [Category]
  [⋯ Kebab Menu] → Opens Overview Modal

Tabs: [Designer Boards*] [Media]

Content: Designer Boards (default)
```

### Files
- ✅ `src/app/project/[id]/OverviewModal.tsx` - NEW (Headless UI Dialog)
- ✅ `src/app/project/[id]/ProjectHero.tsx` - Rewritten (fixed height)
- ✅ `src/app/project/[id]/ProjectTabs.tsx` - Reordered tabs
- ✅ `src/app/project/[id]/page.tsx` - Default to boards

### Impact
**Before:** Land on Overview, expandable hero, scrolling required  
**After:** Land on Boards, fixed hero, more content above fold

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@headlessui/react": "^2.2.9"
}
```

Installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` to bypass zod version conflict.

---

## Database Migrations

### Migration 1: Designer Profile Fields
```sql
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "title" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "phone" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "studio" TEXT;
```

**Status:** ✅ Applied successfully (non-destructive, nullable)

### No Other Migrations
All other changes used **existing schema fields** - no additional migrations needed.

---

## New API Endpoints

### 1. `GET /api/designer/profile`
- Fetches current user's profile + published projects
- Returns: user data + `featuredProjects` array
- Auth: Required (session)
- Cache: Force-dynamic, no caching

### 2. `PUT /api/designer/profile`
- Updates user profile fields
- Body: name, title, bio, location, studio, phone, website, instagram
- Auth: Required (session)
- Security: Whitelisted fields only

### 3. `GET /api/debug/my-projects?filter=all|published|draft`
- Debug endpoint for verifying project queries
- Returns project count + breakdown
- Shows ownership fields
- **Remove after QA**

---

## New Utility Modules

### 1. `src/lib/projectRoutes.ts`
```typescript
export function hrefForProject(project: ProjectNav): string {
  return isPublished(project)
    ? `/project/${project.slug ?? project.id}`
    : `/project/${project.id}/media?onboard=1`;
}
```

### 2. `src/server/queries/getMyProjects.ts`
```typescript
export async function getMyProjects(filter: ProjectFilter = 'all') {
  // Checks all ownership paths
  // Filters by published/draft/all
  // Returns projects array
}
```

---

## The Complete Flow Now

### Creating a Project
```
1. Click "Create" in nav
2. Choose "Quick Create"
3. Enter title → Submit
4. Project created in DB (designerId + ownerId set)
5. Auto-routes to /project/{id}/setup
6. Upload images (persist to DB)
7. Tag products (persist to DB)
8. Publish project
9. Project appears in profile portfolio ✓
```

### Managing Projects
```
Dashboard (/designer):
- See ALL projects
- Drafts show "Continue Setup"
- Published show "Manage Project"

Profile (/designer/profile):
- See PUBLISHED projects only
- Click card → View project
- Professional portfolio showcase
```

### Viewing Projects
```
Click project card:
- Draft → /project/{id}/media?onboard=1 (continue setup)
- Published → /project/{slug} (view public page)

On project page:
- Lands on "Designer Boards" tab
- Fixed-height hero (~256px)
- Click ⋯ → View Overview details in modal
```

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Portfolio vs Workspace Separation
- **Profile = Portfolio** (published only, professional showcase)
- **Dashboard = Workspace** (all projects, management interface)

### 2. Smart Routing
- Draft projects route to setup/editing
- Published projects route to public view
- Single utility function determines correct path

### 3. Database-First
- All data persisted immediately
- No in-memory arrays
- Survives page refreshes and server restarts

### 4. Cache Strategy
- Profile: Force-dynamic, no caching (always fresh)
- Revalidation after mutations
- Client-side no-store fetch

### 5. Null Safety
- Optional chaining everywhere
- Elegant fallbacks ("Add email" vs errors)
- No crashes on missing data

---

## Testing Verification
