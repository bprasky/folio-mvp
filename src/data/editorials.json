    "intro": "Inspired by its location on Sunset Lake, a yacht basin boasting the calmest body of water on the beach, this spectacular custom waterfront home resonates with calming energy. The interior design captures the contemporary Balinese essence of its architecture through natural materials, warm color palettes, modern organic furnishings, and carefully curated art throughout this luxury resort-style residence. The foyer is clad with wood and artwork on each side: a piece by Christopher Wool with a marble console underneath and opposite a piece by Mark Rothko. Tying in the home's exterior facade, the interior walls are clad in high textured slabs of stone.",
