# Media Upload & Product Tagging Flow - Complete Wiring

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Approach:** Wire existing ProjectCreationModal wizard to project creation flow

---

## Problem Solved

**Before:** After creating a project via "Publish Now" or "Project Folder", users were dumped on the project detail page with no clear way to add images and tag products.

**After:** Users are now routed to a dedicated setup wizard that guides them through:
1. ✅ Upload project images
2. ✅ Tag products on images (with affiliate link support)
3. ✅ Review and complete setup

---

## What Was Wired

### 1. Created Setup Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/project/[id]/setup/page.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Onboarding wizard for new projects

**Features:**
- Opens `ProjectCreationModal` in "editing" mode
- Pre-loads existing project data
- Guides through image upload → product tagging
- Redirects to project page on completion
- Loading state while fetching project

**Flow:**
```tsx
1. Load project from `/api/projects/{id}`
2. Open ProjectCreationModal with editingProject prop
3. Modal shows:
   - Details step (pre-filled, can edit)
   - Images step (upload & manage)
   - Tagging step (click image → tag products → affiliate URLs)
4. On complete → redirect to `/project/{id}`
```

---

### 2. Updated Create Flow Redirects ✅
**File:** `src/app/designer/create/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

**A. Long Form Create (Line 69):**
```typescript
// OLD: router.replace(`/project/${id}`);
// NEW:
router.replace(`/project/${id}/setup`);  // ← Routes to wizard
```

**B. Publish Now Flow (Line 319):**
```typescript
// OLD: router.replace(`/project/${projectId}`);
// NEW:
router.replace(`/project/${projectId}/setup`);  // ← Routes to wizard
```

**Impact:** Both "Project Folder" and "Publish Now" paths now open the setup wizard

---

### 3. Added "Continue Setup" Button ✅
**File:** `src/app/designer/page.tsx` (Lines 357-365)

**Feature:** Shows on draft projects without images

```tsx
{/* Show for drafts with no images */}
{(project.status === 'draft' || !project.isPublic) && !project.images?.length && (
  <Link href={`/project/${project.id}/setup`}>
    <FaUpload /> Continue Setup
  </Link>
)}
```

**Styling:** Blue pill badge, matches Folio brand

---

## ProjectCreationModal - The Complete Wizard

### What It Already Does (No Changes Needed!)

**File:** `src/components/ProjectCreationModal.tsx`

**Step 1: Details**
- Project name, description, category
- Client information
- Designer selection (if admin)

**Step 2: Images**
- Add image URLs
- Preview images
- Room assignment
- Image validation
- Error handling for failed loads

**Step 3: Tagging**
- Click on images to place tags
- Search products
- Scrape products from URLs
- Assign products to tag coordinates
- Visual tag markers with hover states
- Affiliate URL generation (via `generateAffiliateUrl`)

**Final:**
- Creates/updates project via `/api/projects`
- Saves images with ProductImage records
- Calls `onProjectCreated` callback

## Affiliate URL Generation

### How It Works (Already Built In!)

**File:** `src/components/ProjectCreationModal.tsx` + `src/lib/urls.ts`

**When tagging products:**
1. User selects product for a tag
2. Modal generates affiliate URL:
   ```typescript
   import { generateAffiliateUrl } from '@/lib/urls';
   
   const affiliateUrl = generateAffiliateUrl(
     product.url,           // Base product URL
     project.designerId,    // Designer for attribution
     project.title          // Campaign name
   );
   ```

3. URL includes UTM parameters:
   ```
   ?utm_source=folio
   &utm_medium=designer
   &utm_campaign=kips-bay-showhouse
   &aff={designerId}
   ```

4. Click tracking ready when you add AffiliateLink model

## What Happens Now

### When You Create a Project:

**Step 1:** Fill in basic details
- Name: "Kips Bay Showhouse"
- Description: Your long description
- Click "Continue to Upload & Tag"

**Step 2:** Automatically redirected to `/project/{id}/setup`

**Step 3:** ProjectCreationModal wizard opens with 3 tabs:
- ✅ **Details** (pre-filled)
- ✅ **Images** (add image URLs or upload)
- ✅ **Tagging** (click images → search products → tag → generates affiliate URLs)

**Step 4:** Click "Create Project" or "Update Project"

**Step 5:** Redirected to `/project/{id}` (final project page)

---

## Entry Points Summary

### From Navigation (2 paths)
1. **"Publish Now"** → Quick create → `/project/{id}/setup` ✅
2. **"Project Folder"** → Full form → `/project/{id}/setup` ✅

### From Designer Profile (2 actions)
1. **"Continue Setup"** button → `/project/{id}/setup` ✅ (for drafts without images)
2. **Publish button** → `publishProjectAction` ✅ (makes draft public)

---

## Affiliate Link Flow

### Current Implementation (Automatic)

When designer tags a product in the ProjectCreationModal:

1. **Click image** → Places tag marker
2. **Select product** → Assigns product to tag
3. **Affiliate URL generated** automatically via `generateAffiliateUrl()`:
   ```
   https://vendor.com/product?utm_source=folio&utm_medium=designer&utm_campaign=kips-bay-showhouse&aff=2aee3242
   ```
4. **URL saved** with ProductTag in database
5. **Displayed** when hovering over tag or in product list

### Future: Click Tracking (When Ready)

When you add the AffiliateLink model:
1. Uncomment lines 122-147 in `src/app/actions/projects.ts`
2. Run migration for AffiliateLink table
3. publishProjectAction will auto-generate unique codes for each tagged product
4. Track clicks via `/api/affiliate/click?code={code}`

## Known Behaviors

### ProjectCreationModal Steps
1. **Details tab** - Can edit project name, description, category
2. **Images tab** - Add/remove images, assign rooms
3. **Tagging tab** - ONLY appears if images exist

**Navigation:**
- "Next" buttons advance through steps
- "Back" buttons return to previous step
- Can skip tagging if no products selected

### Setup Page Behavior
- Fetches project data via `/api/projects/{id}` API
- Passes project to modal as `editingProject` prop
- Modal pre-fills details from existing project
- Updates existing project (doesn't create new one)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Continue Setup" button doesn't appear
**Check:** Does project have images?  
**Why:** Button only shows for drafts WITHOUT images  
**Fix:** This is intentional - once images exist, use Edit button

### Issue: Tagging tab doesn't appear
**Check:** Did you add images in step 2?  
**Why:** Tagging tab only appears when images exist  
**Fix:** Add at least one image URL in the Images step

### Issue: Affiliate URL not generated
**Check:** Is product URL valid?  
**Why:** generateAffiliateUrl needs product.url field  
**Fix:** Ensure products have `url` field in database

### Issue: Setup page shows error
**Check:** Does `/api/projects/{id}` endpoint work?  
**Fix:** Test endpoint: `GET /api/projects/{your-project-id}`

---

## What the Wizard Does Behind the Scenes

### Image Management
```typescript
// Validates image URLs
// Creates ProjectImage records
// Associates images with project
// Handles failed image loads gracefully
```

### Product Tagging
```typescript
// Creates ProductTag with coordinates
// Links tag to ProductImage
// Links tag to Product
// Saves to database (via fixed API)
// Generates affiliate URL per tag
```

### Project Updates
```typescript
// Updates project title, description, category
// Preserves existing data
// Calls onProjectCreated callback
// Triggers parent refresh
```
